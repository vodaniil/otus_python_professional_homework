*Homework 1. Log_analyzer*

**What it is?**

My first project I'm writing to show it to somebody else, so I tried to use PEP-8 in it, despite I don't like <underscore_variable> naming style.
Anyway the main functionaly of this module is to provide simple access to analyzing logs made in a certain style.

**Latest version**

To find a latest stable version of a log_analyzer please visit my github (https://github.com/vodaniil).
To get access to a latest nightly version please contact with me via Slack (U01F3A0LGAJ).

**Documentation**

Whenever you get a single question about how this programm works please let me now via Slack (my Slack ID is provided below). Actually I'm too lazy to write documentation about project that won't be used by anyone.

**Installation**

To install log_analyzer please put it in a root of a project and then simply import it.

**Licensing**

Please see the file called LICENSE
